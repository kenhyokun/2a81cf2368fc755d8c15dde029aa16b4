  - what works?
    - Avatar selection scene. Player can choose avatar and it will affect profile photo.
    - For now, we only play with single, pair, and triple set.
    - Game start from pn to pn
    - No main menu, only avatar selection and gameplay.
    - No loading screen (of course... what to expect...)
